# [261. Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)

You have a graph of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given an integer n and a list of edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return true if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and false otherwise.

**Example 1**:

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[1,4]]
Output: true
```


**Example 2**:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/12/tree2-graph.jpg">

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[1,3],[1,4]]
Output: false
```

## Solution

The difference between graph and tree is that tree do not have loop.

So in this problem, we just need to detect whether there is a loop.

```py
class Solution:
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        if n == 1:
            return True
        
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in edges:
            graph[a].append(b)
            graph[b].append(a)
            
            
        queue = collections.deque([[0, -1]])
        vis = {0}        
        while queue:
            node, prev = queue.popleft()
            for nextnode in graph[node]:
                if nextnode == prev:
                    continue
                if nextnode not in vis:
                    vis.add(nextnode)
                    queue.append([nextnode, node])
                else:
                    return False
        return True if len(vis) == n else False
```
