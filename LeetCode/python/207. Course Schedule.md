# [207. Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1**:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2**:
```
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

## Solution

Acctually this is a **topological sort** problem, we can use BFS to solve it.

The only situation we will return False is that there is a loop, which just like deadlock.

And we can just start from the courses without any prerequsites.

In a word, here are what we need to do:
* Detect the loop
* Use a data structure to record the number of prerequsites, and if the number is 0, we can start learning this course
* Use hash map to build the relation between current couse and its next courses

How to detece the loop? 

For BFS, we can use queue to put next courses without prerequsite, and if the queue is empty, which means we finished all of the courses without prerequsite, and there still have some courses we do not take, which means there must be a loop.

```py
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        inCnt = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        if not prerequisites:
            return True
        
        for prev, cur in prerequisites:
            graph[prev].append(cur)
            inCnt[cur] += 1
        
        queue = collections.deque()

        # find the start courses without prerequsites
        for node in graph.keys():
            if inCnt[node] == 0:
                queue.append(node)
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for nextCourse in graph[node]:
                inCnt[nextCourse] -= 1
                # if this course do not have any constrain, we can put it into queue
                # we can start learning this course next semester
                if inCnt[nextCourse] == 0:
                    queue.append(nextCourse)
            graph.pop(node)
        
        return True if len(graph) == 0 else False
